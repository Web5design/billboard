# Purpose

This program will cycle through a mix of user provided content (images, video and text), in
manner that is visually captivating. It is well suited to foyer and marketing
displays. For example, the system has been used to display the following:

*	**A research group**, via examples of projects being undertaken by the group.
*	**A undergraduate course**, via examples of students work.
*	**A special interest group**, such as a Computer Science Student Association (CSSA) by showing images from group events.

Some of the key features of the system include:

*	Easy, one-time set up for each display computer.
*	Once set up, the system does not require an internet connection. Theoretically, it should continue to function indefinitely.
*	It only requires Chrome (web-browser) to be installed, making it both free and cross-platform.
*	It includes a script to help set up a computer from scratch. The script allows for an operational period to be specified, allowing each display computer to run unaided.
*	The system automatically deterimines how to display the content, including a full-screen slideshow mode.
*	Includes support for text, images, video and [Processing](www.processing.org) artworks.
